by Hausmann, Neubauer, Ruckhofer

A fitnesstool to assess the BMI. 

The BMI is a parameter for determining one's own overweight/underweight status:

BMI = body mass (kg) / height squared (m**2).

It is interpreted as follows:

Severe underweight < 16 
Moderate underweight 16 - < 17
Slight underweight 17 - < 18.5

Normal weight 18,5 - < 25 

Preadiposity 25 - < 30 

Adiposity I 30 - < 35 
Adiposity II 35 - < 40
Obesity III â‰¥ 40
